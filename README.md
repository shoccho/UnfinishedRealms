This is not a game, not even a poc. 
it is a throwaway project to learn some 2d game making stufss using java without opengl, 

this also sapwned a new project https://github.com/shoccho/tileMapCreator (use this to create maps for this game like thing) 

I plan on adding some stuffs here(npc, particles, combat, events etc) but there is no story or actual gameplay planned. also drawing assets are a huge hurdle for me and I am not comfortable sharing anyone eleses arts as opensource
